## Structure
[meta documentation](meta/README.md)

## Motivation
The purpose of this personal project is to organize information of interest into an easily accessible format.
It is meant to be something like a collection:
- compendium (sp?)
- bibliographies
- references
- tutorials
- notebooks

I do not know of a proper word for a project like this, suggestions are welcome.

## Installation
This wetware application requires the standard installation toolkit
- Reading
- Practice
- Discussion

I understand that the instillation is difficult, and the tools cumbersome.  Although great progress has been made in the last 10,000 years, there is still a lot of work left to do.

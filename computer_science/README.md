# Algorithms
## Big O Notation
## Sorting
## Binary Search
## Depth-first
## Breadth-first
## Dijkstra's algorithm
## Greedy Algorithms
## Dynamic Programming
## K-nearest Neighbors
## Linear Programming, Simplex algorithm
for optimization with a set of constraints

# Test Driven Development
"TEST FIRST!"

## Principles of good Tests

1. Be Expressive, not Exhaustive.
2. fast and easy to run.  Minimal setup time, prefer builtins to frameworks
3. keep it simple.  Each test tests only one thing.

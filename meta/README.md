These documents make heavy use of [github's relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes/)

The [Epic Github Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md): A collection of cool hidden and not so hidden features of Git and GitHub.


## Document Structure

### Summary
Define the subject.  Why is it interesting and worth study.  What should we learn from the course.

First day of class synopsis.

### [Glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary)
"A glossary, also known as a vocabulary, or clavis, is an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms."

[learn python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/preface.html): "Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition."

Guides focused on learning by doing.

### Examples and Projects
Practical Applications:
- Experiments and experimental data
- Example code like the [deep dream notebook](https://github.com/google/deepdream)
- Demonstration Videos and code


## External References and References
For now, all cited sources will be treated equally, and cited in-line.

### Books
Referencing books is hard, and a cursory look at citation formats started my head spinning.

Until a better solution presents its self, I am going to cite books using [google books](https://support.google.com/books/answer/80658?hl=en)

EX: [The Invention of Science](https://books.google.com/books?id=7exeBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20invention%20of%20science)

note: Strip the link down to just the ID, or ID and dq={title} so that the title is included if the link breaks.

"https://books.google.com/books?id=7exeBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20invention%20of%20science"

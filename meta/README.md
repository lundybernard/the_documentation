## Citation
Referencing books is hard, and a cursory look at citation formats started my head spinning.

Until a better solution presents its self, I am going to cite books using [google books](https://support.google.com/books/answer/80658?hl=en)

EX: [The Invention of Science](https://books.google.com/books?id=7exeBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20invention%20of%20science&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=the%20invention%20of%20science&f=false)

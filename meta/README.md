These documents make heavy use of [github's relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes/)

The [Epic Github Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) May also prove helpful

## Citation
Referencing books is hard, and a cursory look at citation formats started my head spinning.

Until a better solution presents its self, I am going to cite books using [google books](https://support.google.com/books/answer/80658?hl=en)

EX: [The Invention of Science](https://books.google.com/books?id=7exeBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20invention%20of%20science)

note: Strip the link down to just the ID, or ID and dq={title} so that the title is included if the link breaks.

"https://books.google.com/books?id=7exeBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20invention%20of%20science"

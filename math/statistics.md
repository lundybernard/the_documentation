## Key Concepts
### Quantifying Uncertainty:

### Naive Definition
Assuming that:

1. All events (outcomes) are equally likely to occur
2. The Sample Space is finite.

Then:
```
P(A):
"""The probability of Event A"""
```

Is the number of Events (A), divided by the number of possible events (S)

### Counting
#### The Multiplication Rule:
